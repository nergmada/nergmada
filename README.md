### Bio
I'm Adam, a 20 something* programmer, scientist and engineer from the South of England. I wanted to be a film and TV writer and director, but some how ended up becoming a Computer Scientist. I try to remain well-versed in both the theory and practical knowledge in my field and generally across the board. In my spare time I (surprisingly) like watching TV and Movies, Cycling, spending time with my partner, and any kind of board game that involves some kind of deception or motive obfuscation. 

I'm always happy to answer any questions one might have, so please feel free to drop me a line above, and see if I can be of any use.

\*I use to save me the effort of rewriting in April
